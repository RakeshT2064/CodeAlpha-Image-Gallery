3. **Gallery Items**
   - Each item contains an image and overlay with caption
   - Data attributes (`data-category`) for filtering functionality
   - Local image paths from the img directory

4. **Lightbox Component**
   - Hidden by default, shown when an image is clicked

   - Event listener for DOM content loaded

2. **Filtering Functionality**
   - Event listeners for filter buttons
   - Toggle display of gallery items based on category
   - Update filtered items array for lightbox navigation
   - Visual feedback for active filter

3. **Lightbox Implementation**
   - Open lightbox on gallery item click
   - Display selected image with caption
   - Close lightbox with button or background click
   - Prevent body scrolling when lightbox is open

4. **Navigation**
   - Next/previous buttons functionality
   - Keyboard navigation with arrow keys and Escape
   - Circular navigation (loop back to first/last image)
   - Update image source and caption during navigation

5. **Transition Effects**
   - Fade in/out effects using CSS classes and setTimeout
   - Smooth transitions between images

## Responsive Design

The gallery adapts to different screen sizes through media queries:

1. **Desktop (Default)**
   - Grid with 250px minimum column width
   - 20px gap between items
   - 250px image height
   - 50px navigation buttons

2. **Tablet (max-width: 768px)**
   - Grid with 200px minimum column width
   - 15px gap between items
   - 40px navigation buttons

3. **Mobile (max-width: 480px)**
   - Grid with 150px minimum column width
   - 10px gap between items
   - 180px image height
   - 35px navigation buttons
   - Smaller filter buttons with adjusted padding

## How to Use
